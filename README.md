# DataCrumbs
## ui breadcrumbs for data

This component is an alternative JS GUI to the Attribute selector in [Weave] (http://www.iweave.com).  
It allows navigation down a hierarchy, for the selection of data columns.


* Each crumb represent one level of the hierarchy and can be chosen from a drop down selector.
* The arrow glyph indicates if further navigation of the hierarchy is possible.
* If a crumb is clicked, the drop down selector is populated with a crumb's respective siblings.
* If the arrow is clicked , the drop down selector is populated with a crumb's respective children.

The current version is designed only for Weave.

See the crumb addition in progression. I will paste a demo link very soon.
