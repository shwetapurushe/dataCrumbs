# DataCrumbs
## ui breadcrumbs for data

This component is an alternative JS GUI to the Attribute selector in [Weave] (http://www.iweave.com).  
It allows navigation down a hierarchy, for the selection of data columns.
Each crumb represent one level of the hierarchy and can be chosen from a drop down selector. The drop down selector is populated it with a crumb's respective siblings.  
The current version is designed only for Weave. 

See the crumb addition in progression. I will paste a demo link very soon.
Simple demo pic.
